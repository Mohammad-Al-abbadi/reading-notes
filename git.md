Git :
it is a version control system which means everytime you change something in your project it will be recorded with a lot of information such as who commited the edit and when was it meaning you can work togather with your team or you group

this helps a lot by saving effort and time as it happens automatically.

Using a version control system helps in :
tracking the project history
working togather as a group
A version control system can be divided into 3 main types: 1.The centralized VCS (In this type all team members connect to a central server to get the latest copy of the code and to share the changes with others.) 2.The distributed VCS (In this type all team members has a local copy of the code with its history on the machine with saved snapshots and can be syncronized with others) 3.The local VCS (all the files stored locally on the harddisk)

Git is a distributed version conrtol system
