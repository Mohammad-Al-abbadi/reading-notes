#Think about the stories you
read in a newspaper: for each
story, there will be a headline,
some text, and possibly some
images. If the article is a long
piece, there may be subheadings
that split the story into separate
sections or quotes from those
involved. Structure helps readers
understand the stories in the
newspaper.


##The use of headings and
subheadings in any document
often reflects a hierarchy of
information. For example, a
document might start with
a large heading, followed by
an introduction or the most
important information.

>The opening <html> tag indicates that anything between it and a closing </html> tag is HTML code.
The <body> tag indicates that anything between it and the closing
</body> tag should be shown inside the main browser window.
Words between <h1> and </h1> are a main heading.
A paragraph of text appears between these <p> and </p> tags.
Words between <h2> and </h2> form a sub-heading.
Here is another paragraph between opening <p> and closing </p> tags.
Another sub-heading inside <h2> and </h2> tags.
Another paragraph inside <p> and </p> tags.
The closing </body> tag indicates the end of what should appear in the main browser window.
The closing </html> tag indicates that it is the end of the HTML code.
